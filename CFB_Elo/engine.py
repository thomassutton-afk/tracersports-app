"""
College Football (CFB) Elo engine.

Forked from NFL_Elo's engine.py. Same weekly-batch replay structure,
same rest-day/K-decay/margin-of-victory formulas as a starting point -
see WEEKLY BATCHING and REST-DAY CONVENTION below, both carried over
unchanged. The one REAL structural difference from the NFL version is
how conference/division games get identified - see CONFERENCE/DIVISION
LOOKUP below. Everything else in BASELINE_PARAMS is an untuned starting
point copied from NFL_Elo, not validated for CFB - see this module's
BASELINE_PARAMS comment.

WEEKLY BATCHING - carried over from NFL_Elo unchanged: games are NOT
processed strictly one at a time in date order. Every game within the
same CFB week snapshots every playing team's rating BEFORE any of that
week's results are applied, and ratings only update once, after the
whole week's math is computed - see process_week(). Call process_week()
once per week, in chronological week order - never process_game() on
an individual game in isolation for a real result.

REST-DAY CONVENTION - also carried over unchanged: days_off here is the
RAW calendar gap between a team's games (no -1), and a team's first
game of a season gets NO rest adjustment at all.

CONFERENCE/DIVISION LOOKUP - genuinely different from NFL_Elo. NFL's
conference/division assignment is a small, fixed, code-keyed table with
exactly one realignment event (2002) to branch on. CFB has 130+
programs, realignment happens most years, and a program's CODE doesn't
change when it switches conferences - a static in-engine table would
need constant hand-maintenance and would silently go stale. Instead,
each game dict passed to process_week()/preview_matchup() is expected
to already carry `home_conf`/`away_conf` (and optional `home_div`/
`away_div`), resolved by the CALLER via db.conference_for_season()
before reaching this module - see rebuild.py's `_annotate_conferences`.
This keeps the actual Elo math here just as DB-free as NFL_Elo's, while
letting conference membership live in `team_conference_history` (a
real table, editable via franchise.py's `realign` command) instead of
a hardcoded dict. A team with no conference on file for that season
(independent, or an FCS opponent with no row yet) resolves to
home_conf/away_conf of None, which this module treats as "not a
conference or division game" - never an error.

SEASON-ENTRY - genuinely new, no NFL_Elo equivalent (NFL_Elo blends
every team toward the SAME flat `base` constant between seasons). CFB
programs sit at wildly different competitive tiers that roughly track
their conference, so this engine blends toward a CONFERENCE (or
power/midmajor tier, for independents) average instead of one shared
number. This engine stays completely DB-free, same as everywhere else
in this module - the caller (rebuild.py) does every database lookup
and hands this engine two already-resolved things per season, via
regress_returning_team()/induct_new_team() below, called ONCE per
season boundary before that season's first process_week():
  - For a team already tracked (played FBS before): regress toward
    the average rating of every team that shared ITS conference LAST
    season (not this season - see rebuild.py's `_compute_season_targets`
    for why realignment year handling falls out of this naturally). An
    independent draws from the power or midmajor tier pool instead
    (Notre Dame -> power; every other independent -> midmajor).
  - For a team never tracked before (a true FBS debut, OR a former
    FCS opponent - fixed-rating, never persisted - becoming FBS for
    the first time): no prior rating exists to blend from, so it
    starts at a 50/50 blend of the fixed fcs_rating constant and its
    NEW conference's average (computed from that conference's
    already-resolved RETURNING members only, to avoid circularity
    between multiple teams debuting into the same conference the same
    season).
`base` (1500) is now only a fallback: the very first loaded season has
no prior-season data to compute any average from, and a conference
with zero already-resolved members to reference at all (its every
member is debuting the same season) falls back to the overall FBS
average.

POSTSEASON - PHASE 1 of a larger deferred effort (see add_season.py's
normalizer docstring). Only conference championship games are
currently classified (Round=="CCG"), via a dedicated
conf_championship_mult - bowl/CFP-round classification is still fully
deferred, since the postseason FORMAT itself changed multiple times
across 1996-2025 (no unified system pre-1998, BCS 1998-2013, 4-team
CFP 2014-2023, 12-team CFP 2024+) and needs real era-branching logic
that doesn't exist yet. NFL_Elo's playoff_round_mult mechanism is left
in place but empty/unused for now - it only ever applies to type='P'
games, and every CFB game (CCGs included) is still type='R' by design
(see add_season.py's docstring on why postseason isn't reclassified
as type='P' yet).

FCS HANDLING - genuinely new, no NFL_Elo equivalent (the NFL has no
lower-division opponents at all). CFB has 130+ programs and regularly
schedules FCS/lower-division opponents as early-season "buy games."
Since this dataset only ever
covers FBS schedules, an FCS opponent NEVER has an FCS-vs-FCS game in
it - only the occasional lopsided game against an FBS team. Tracking
an FCS opponent's OWN rating off that thin, biased sample would be
close to pure noise, and a rename mid-transition (a real case: Texas
A&M-Commerce became "East Texas A&M" while remaining FCS the whole
time) can silently split one program across two team_ids with no way
to tell they're the same school - a real problem if either side were
being tracked continuously. Instead, ANY team not recorded as FBS for
a given season (via `fbs_membership` - see db.py) is treated as a
fixed-strength opponent: process_week() substitutes a single tunable
`fcs_rating` constant for that side's rating, uses it only to compute
the FBS side's expected outcome and rating change, and never creates,
updates, or persists a TeamState or a ratings row for it. The FBS
opponent's own win/loss and rating update are entirely unaffected -
beating an FCS team still counts as a normal win, using this fixed
number as the opponent strength input. `fcs_rating` is a single global
constant, not a per-team rating - see BASELINE_PARAMS below; use
cfb_tune_engine.py to find a reasonable value once real games are
loaded.
