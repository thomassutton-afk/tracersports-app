"""
Replay every game in `games` into `ratings`, from scratch.

Forked from NFL_Elo's rebuild.py - same weekly-batch replay shape (see
engine.py's module docstring for why CFB, like NFL, processes games in
WEEKLY BATCHES rather than strictly one at a time). rebuild_ratings()
here groups every game by (season, week) - using the same
week_from_date() bucketing add_season.py uses when loading new games -
and calls engine.process_week() once per week, in chronological
(season, week) order.

ECHO / PULSE VARIANTS - same pair NFL/NBA/WNBA compute, same underlying
principle: Echo is the continuous-carryover model (a team's rating
regresses toward the mean between seasons, never resets); Pulse resets
every team to base rating at the start of each season (alpha forced to
0). variant_params() below composes with db.params_for_season() (a
per-season alpha/kmax/hfa override mechanism, for future in-season
tuning) the same way NFL_Elo's does: Echo gets whatever
params_for_season already resolves for that season; Pulse is the SAME
per-season params with alpha forced to 0.0.

CONFERENCE ANNOTATION - genuinely new vs. NFL_Elo. Because CFB's
conference/division classification comes from `team_conference_history`
rather than a static in-engine table (see engine.py's module
docstring), every game dict needs home_conf/away_conf/home_div/away_div
attached BEFORE it reaches engine.process_week() or preview_matchup().
`_annotate_conferences()` below does that lookup once per game, right
after loading from the database - engine.py itself stays completely
DB-free. Until `team_conference_history` is actually populated (a
separate, not-yet-built loading process), every lookup resolves to
None and every game is scored as "not a conference/division game" -
that's an expected, harmless starting state, not a bug.

FBS ANNOTATION - `_annotate_conferences()` also attaches home_is_fbs/
away_is_fbs via db.is_fbs(), for engine.py's FCS HANDLING (see its
module docstring). Until load_conference_membership.py has been run
for a season, every team in it looks non-FBS - unlike the conference
annotation above, this is NOT a harmless default: it means every team
that season gets treated as a fixed-rating FCS opponent (no persisted
rating at all) until that catches up. load_conference_membership.py
now triggers its own rebuild specifically because of this.

         but ONLY from the now-regressed returning teams (never from
         a team also debuting this same season, to avoid circularity
         between multiple teams debuting into the same conference the
         same year).
