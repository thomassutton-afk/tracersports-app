normalize_sr_games.py

Converts a raw Sports-Reference CFB schedule/scores export (one row per
GAME - Winner, Winner's Pts, an unlabeled site-indicator column, Loser,
Loser's Pts, Notes) into the standardized per-team-perspective shape
add_season.py expects: Date, Season, Type, Round, Team, Opp, HomeAway,
PointsFor, PointsAgainst, OT, TeamAPRank, OppAPRank - one row per team
per game (both perspectives), same convention as NFL_Elo's
normalize_parsed_games.py.

SITE-INDICATOR COLUMN: Sports-Reference's raw export has no header for
this column (it sits between the winner's points and the loser's name),
so pandas reads it in as "Unnamed: N". Its values:
    ""  (blank) -> the Winner was the HOME team
    "@"         -> the Winner was the AWAY team (played at the Loser's
                   home stadium - the Loser was actually the home team)
    "N"         -> neutral site; neither team was truly "home"

WHAT THIS DOES:
  - Emits TWO output rows per raw game row (one per team's own
    perspective), each carrying that team's own HomeAway tag
    ('H'/'A'/'N') for this game.
  - Strips and preserves the AP poll rank prefix, e.g. "(11) Penn
    State" -> name="Penn State", rank=11 -> into TeamAPRank/OppAPRank.
    Display-only; the Elo engine never reads these (see db.py's module
    docstring).
  - Derives a stable team CODE by slugifying the full team name (e.g.
    "Southern California" -> "southern-california", "Miami (FL)" ->
    "miami-fl", "Louisiana-Monroe" -> "louisiana-monroe") - CFB has no
    standard stable abbreviation the way NFL codes exist, so
    add_season.py's franchise auto-registration keys off these slugs
    going forward. A genuine program name change later goes through
    team_history/team_aliases, same as any other rename - this script
    does not need to know about that; it just slugifies whatever name
    appears in a given season's file.
  - Assigns Season as the FALL year a season is conventionally labeled
    under, even for games played in January/February of the following
    calendar year (bowl games) - date.month <= 6 means "belongs to
    last year's season."
  - Type is ALWAYS 'R' for every game, including bowls and conference
    championships - postseason games are NOT reclassified as type='P'.
    Round classification (PHASE 2 - see classify_round() below) is
    era-branched, since the postseason FORMAT itself changed multiple
    times across 1996-2025 (no unified system pre-1998, BCS 1998-2013,
    4-team CFP 2014-2023, 12-team CFP 2024+):
      - "NC" (national championship): explicit in Notes from 2006
        onward ("BCS Championship" 2006-2013, "College Football
        Playoff National Championship" 2014+). For 1998-2005, the BCS
        title game was just whichever of Rose/Sugar/Orange/Fiesta was
        that year's designated host in the normal rotation, with NO
        distinguishing text in Notes - see BCS_EMBEDDED_TITLE_BOWL,
        cross-referenced against BCS history and confirmed directly
        against the 1998 and 2000 raw files.
      - "CFP-R1" (12-team first round): explicit in Notes from 2024
        onward ("College Football Playoff - First Round").
      - "CFP-SF" (semifinal): explicit host-bowl-pair-by-season lookup
        (CFP_SEMIFINAL_PAIR) - the semifinal bowls are NEVER named as
        such in Notes (just the host bowl's normal name), in either
        the 4-team (2014-2023) or 12-team (2024+) era.
      - "CFP-QF" (12-team quarterfinal, 2024+ only): whichever New
        Year's Six bowl isn't that season's semifinal host - also
        never explicitly named as a quarterfinal in Notes.
      - "CCG" (conference championship): "Championship" appearing in
        Notes, e.g. "SEC Championship (Atlanta GA)" - reliable across
        every era regardless of exact conference name, but ONLY once
        NC is ruled out first (both "BCS Championship" and "College
        Football Playoff National Championship" also contain the
        word "Championship").
      - "BOWL" (every other bowl, non-playoff): "Bowl" appearing in
        Notes. Deliberately NOT split into a hardcoded "major bowl"
        list - the engine instead scores a BOWL game's importance
        directly off the two teams' own AP ranks (TeamAPRank/
        OppAPRank, already carried through below), which needs no
        era-branching and better reflects that a mediocre edition of
        a historically major bowl isn't actually more important than
        an elite matchup in a smaller one.
      - None: regular season.
    The raw Notes text is carried through to the output CSV regardless
    of era, so this classification can be revised later without
    re-running this normalizer against the original raw file again.
  - OT is hardcoded to 0 for every row - this source format carries no
    overtime flag. Revisit if/when a source with real OT data is added.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO:
  - No conference/division assignment (`team_conference_history` is
    populated through a separate process - this source has no
    conference column at all).
  - No FBS/FCS filtering - every team that appears (including an FCS
    opponent in a given box score) gets registered, consistent with
    the "start FBS, leave door open" scope decision.
