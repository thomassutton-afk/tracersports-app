"""SQLite storage for the College Football (CFB) Elo model.

Forked from NFL_Elo's db.py - same team-identity model, same core
schema shape. Differences from the NFL version are called out below;
everything not mentioned works exactly like NFL_Elo.

TEAM IDENTITY MODEL
--------------------
`teams.team_id` is a permanent synthetic ID (e.g. "cfb_0001") assigned
once to a program and never changed. It carries no meaning of its own -
it's just a stable peg for `games` and `ratings` to reference.

Every human-readable code a program has ever played under - including
whatever it currently uses - lives in `team_aliases`, resolved to that
permanent ID via `resolve_team_id`. No single code is privileged as
"the real one." Unlike NFL, CFB has no standard stable abbreviation
source, so `add_season.py`'s normalizer derives a code by slugifying
the team's full name as it appears in source data (e.g. "Southern
California" -> "southern-california", "Miami (FL)" -> "miami-fl").
A genuine name change (not a code change - see CFB-SPECIFIC ADDITIONS
below) still goes through `team_aliases`/`team_history` the same way
an NFL relocation does.

`team_history` tracks which code/name a program used during which
seasons, so you can ask "what was this program called in 1996?" vs
"in 2010?" even though both are the same team_id. `teams.team_name`
remains a simple current-name fallback for convenience/older callers.

CFB-SPECIFIC SCHEMA ADDITIONS
------------------------------
- `games`/`schedule` carry `home_code`/`away_code` (the slugified
  team code) alongside `home_team`/`away_team` (the permanent
  synthetic team_id), same reasoning as NFL_Elo: keeps engine.py able
  to work off game data without a database round-trip.
- `games`/`schedule` also carry nullable `home_ap_rank`/`away_ap_rank`
  (the AP poll rank at kickoff, parsed from source data like
  "(11) Penn State"). Display-only - the Elo engine never reads these.
- `ratings` carries `conf_game`/`div_game` (whether this was a
  conference/division matchup) and `t` (ties), on top of the same
  columns NBA/WNBA use - same as NFL_Elo. Note division games are far
  less common in CFB than NFL (most conferences dropped divisions in
  the 2020s realignment wave); `div_game` will legitimately be 0/NULL
  for most games and most conferences.
- NEW: `team_conference_history` tracks which conference a program
  belonged to during which seasons (e.g. Oklahoma: Big 12 through
  2023, SEC from 2024). This is DELIBERATELY separate from
  `team_history` - conference realignment is not a relocation or
  rebrand, a program's code/name usually don't change when it
  switches conferences, so this needed its own era-scoped table
  rather than overloading team_history's meaning.
- No `franchise.py` relocate/revive equivalent - CFB programs don't
  physically relocate or fold-and-revive the way NFL/NBA franchises
  occasionally do. See franchise.py's module docstring for what
  replaced those commands.

    "updated" (an exact (team_id, start_season) row already existed and

    after a KNOWN_ALIASES fix), "inserted" (a new era was added), or
    "unchanged" (an existing era already covering this season already
    has this exact conference/division - nothing to do).

    How it stays order-independent:
      1. If a row already exists for EXACTLY this (team_id,
         start_season), update it in place instead of inserting a
         second row - this is what a naive close-then-insert would
         collide on.
      2. Only closes a era that's genuinely PRIOR (start_season
         strictly less than this one) and open/overlapping - never
         blindly closes "whatever has end_season IS NULL", since that
         row might actually start AFTER this season if seasons were
         recorded out of order.
      3. Sets this era's own end_season based on the next
         chronologically LATER era already on file (if any) - so
         backfilling an earlier season after a later one already
