"""
Add a new season's CFB games to the database, from a single command.

Forked from NFL_Elo's add_season.py - same load/rebuild pipeline shape.
Differences from the NFL version are called out below.

Usage:
    python3 add_season.py /path/to/parsed_games_2025.csv

Expects a file already in the normalized shape produced by
normalize_sr_games.py: Date, Season, Type (always 'R' for now - see
below), Round (always blank/None for now), Team, Opp (slugified team
codes, e.g. "ohio-state" - NOT full team names, NOT NFL-style
abbreviations), HomeAway ('H'/'A'/'N'), PointsFor, PointsAgainst, OT
(always 0 for now), TeamAPRank, OppAPRank (nullable AP poll rank at
kickoff - display-only). If you're loading a brand new season for the
first time, run that normalizer on the raw Sports-Reference export
first - this script does not do team-name-to-code translation itself;
that's a one-time file-format fix, not an ongoing per-load step.

DEFERRED FOR NOW (per project decision, revisit later):
  - Postseason classification: bowls and conference championships load
    with Type='R' and Round=None, exactly like every other game -
    normalize_sr_games.py does not split them out or tag them. They
    fully participate in ratings/standings as regular games until a
    dedicated postseason-classification pass is built.
  - Overtime: OT is always 0 from this source (no OT flag exists in
    it). Revisit once a source with real OT data is added.
  - Conference/division game classification is NOT populated by this
    script - `team_conference_history` (and therefore conf_game/
    div_game on every rating row) stays empty until conference data is
    loaded through a separate process. See rebuild.py's
    `_annotate_conferences` and engine.py's module docstring.

A row with a real score goes into `games` (and affects ratings). A row
with everything else but NO score yet (e.g. a future game on the
schedule) goes into `schedule` instead - it is never treated as a 0-0
result, and never touches the rating engine.

It will:
  1. Auto-detect any team codes not already in the database and
     register them as brand new programs - each gets a permanent
     synthetic team_id (e.g. "cfb_0131") and an era-scoped history
     entry starting at the earliest season the code appears in this
     file. Unlike NFL (32 fixed franchises, this rarely fires), this
     is EXPECTED to fire often for CFB - new FBS entrants, FCS
     opponents, or just teams not yet loaded from an earlier season.
  2. Insert every completed game (deduped automatically - re-running on
     the same file is always safe).
  3. Route unplayed games to `schedule`.
  4. Rebuild the FULL ratings history from every game in the database,
     week by week (see rebuild.py / engine.py's module docstring for
     why this replays week-by-week rather than game-by-game).
  5. Run a handful of sanity checks and print a standings summary.

Naming a new team:
    New teams get registered with team_name == their slugified code
    (e.g. "ohio-state") as a placeholder, so nothing blocks the load.
    Fix the display name afterward with:

        python3 -c "import db; c=db.connect('cfb_elo.db'); \\
            db.rename_current_history(c, 'cfb_0131', 'Ohio State'); \\
            db.upsert_team(c,'cfb_0131','Ohio State'); c.commit()"

    (Use franchise.py status to look up a code's team_id.)
