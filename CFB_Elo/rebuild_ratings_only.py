"""
rebuild_ratings_only.py

Rebuilds ratings for both variants (echo, pulse) WITHOUT touching
`games`/`schedule` at all - no re-normalizing, no reloading, no
dedup pass. Use this whenever something that affects the RATING MATH
itself changes (a param_schedule.json update, an engine.py/db.py fix
like the fcs_rating merge-key bug) but the underlying game data hasn't
changed - reingest_phase2.py does far more work than that (re-runs
normalize_sr_games.py against every raw file, deletes and reloads
every season) and is the wrong tool when only the math changed, not
the data.

Usage:
    python3 rebuild_ratings_only.py cfb_elo.db
