"""
Manage CFB program renames, conference realignment, and the rare
fold/revival reset.

Forked from NFL_Elo's franchise.py, but trimmed and reshaped for what
actually happens in college football: programs essentially never
physically relocate the way NFL/NBA franchises occasionally do, so
`relocate` (NFL_Elo's main command) is DROPPED entirely. Conference
realignment - a program switching conferences, which happens most
years and is genuinely common - gets a NEW `realign` command instead,
operating on `team_conference_history` (a table with no NFL_Elo
equivalent - see db.py's module docstring).

Every command below takes --current-code, not a team_id - team_id is a
permanent internal database key you should never need to know or type
(see franchise.py status if you ever want to look one up). You always
identify a program by whatever code it's CURRENTLY known by.

RENAME (a program's display name changes, code stays the same):

    python3 franchise.py rename --current-code southern-california --name "USC"

    Does NOT start a new team_history era - it just corrects the name
    on the currently-open one (e.g. fixing a placeholder name right
    after a program was registered, or a cosmetic full-name change).

REALIGNMENT (a program switches conferences - code/name usually don't
change; rating carries over unaffected, since conference membership
never feeds the rating math itself, only conf_game/div_game display
flags):

    python3 franchise.py realign --current-code oklahoma --conference SEC --season 2024

    Closes the program's currently-open team_conference_history era at
    --season minus one and opens a new one at --season under the new
    --conference (and optional --division, for conferences that still
    use them). This is a DISPLAY/classification change only - it does
    not touch `ratings` or trigger a rebuild, since conf_game/div_game
    flags are computed live from team_conference_history at rebuild
    time (see rebuild.py's `_annotate_conferences`), not stored
    statically. Run rebuild.py afterward if you want existing rating
    rows' conf_game/div_game flags to reflect the change immediately;
    otherwise it'll simply apply automatically the next time ratings
    get rebuilt for any other reason (e.g. the next add_season.py run).

FOLD + REVIVAL (a program discontinues football and later revives it
under the same code/brand - rating must NOT carry over; genuinely rare
in CFB, kept mainly for schema parity with NFL/NBA/WNBA):

    python3 franchise.py revive --current-code some-program --season 2010 --name "Some Program"

    Forces that team_id's rating to reset to the base rating (1500) at
    the start of the given season, ignoring whatever it ended on before
    it stopped playing. Starts a new team_history era at that season.

IMPORTANT: a program has to already be REGISTERED before you can run
any of these against it - i.e. it needs to have appeared in at least
one season file loaded via add_season.py already (which is what
actually creates its team_id in the first place).

After `rename` or `realign`, no rebuild is needed (neither affects the
rating math). After `revive`, ratings ARE rebuilt automatically, since
it forces a reset.
