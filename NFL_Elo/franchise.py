Manage franchise relocations and fold/revival resets.

Every command below takes --current-code, not a team_id - team_id is a
permanent internal database key you should never need to know or type
(see franchise.py status if you ever want to look one up). You always
identify a team by whatever code it's CURRENTLY known by.

RELOCATION (same franchise, new city - rating carries over):

    python3 franchise.py relocate --current-code SD --name "Los Angeles Chargers" --season 2017

    Most real relocations do NOT change the code used in source files
    (the Chargers' move to LA stayed coded "SD" throughout - that's
    this dataset's own convention, matching how Continelo tags every
    era of a franchise under one constant code). This closes the old
    team_history era at --season minus one and opens a new one at
    --season, under the SAME code, with the new display name - so old
    seasons still show "San Diego Chargers" and new ones show "Los
    Angeles Chargers", even though nothing in the source files or the
    alias table changes.

    Pass --alias only on the rarer occasion a relocation genuinely
    changes the code itself:

    python3 franchise.py relocate --current-code OLD --alias NEW --name "New City Team" --season 2030

    This additionally registers NEW as an alias for the same team_id,
    so future files using the new code merge into this franchise's
    existing history instead of registering a brand new team.

    You do NOT need this if a franchise's code stays the same but its
    name/city changes cosmetically - for that just rename it:

    python3 franchise.py rename --current-code WAS --name "Washington Football Team"

    A plain rename does NOT start a new team_history era - it just
    corrects the name on the currently-open one (e.g. fixing a
    placeholder name right after a team was registered).

FOLD + REVIVAL (a team folds, and the same code/brand is reused later
for what is functionally a new franchise - rating must NOT carry over):

    python3 franchise.py revive --current-code CLE --season 1999 --name "Cleveland Browns"

    This forces that team_id's rating to reset to the base rating
    (1500) at the start of the 1999 season, ignoring whatever it ended
    on before it folded (the actual Cleveland Browns case: the NFL
    ruled the Browns' history/records stayed in Cleveland when the
    original franchise moved to Baltimore in 1996, so the 1999 "CLE"
    team is treated as a fresh expansion franchise reusing the name -
    not a continuation of the team that moved). Starts a new
    team_history era at that season. Only needed if the SAME code is
    reused - a genuinely new team_id (e.g. an expansion team with a
    fresh abbreviation, like Houston in 2002) already starts at 1500
    automatically and needs no action here.

FOLDING itself needs no action - a team just stops appearing in future
season files. Nothing in the database needs to change when a team
folds; you only need `revive` if/when it comes back under the same code.

IMPORTANT: a team has to already be REGISTERED before you can run any
of these against it - i.e. it needs to have appeared in at least one
season file loaded via add_season.py already (which is what actually
creates its team_id in the first place), UNLESS it was pre-seeded via
seed_franchise_history.py - see TEMPLATE.md section 8. NFL's full
relocation history (1996-present) is already known, so it should be
pre-seeded rather than relocated live between season loads - reach for
this script mainly for something genuinely new going forward (a future
relocation/expansion not yet in that seed data).

After any of these, ratings are rebuilt automatically (relocate/rename
don't affect the math, only display - but revive does, since it forces
a reset).
