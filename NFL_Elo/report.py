"""
Dump the database into plain, readable files - no SQLite browser needed.

Usage:
    python3 report.py

Produces, in a `reports/` folder next to the database:
    standings.csv     - one row per team per season (W/L/T, final Elo, rank)
    game_log.csv       - every game with both teams' ratings before/after
    summary.txt        - a plain-text standings report you can just open

Run this any time you want a fresh look at the data - it always
reflects whatever is currently in nfl_elo.db.
