"""
NFL Elo engine.

Faithful reimplementation of the NFL "Continelo" workbook's Elo system
(the math previously lived directly in nfl_elo.py's compute_elo(); this
restructures it into the shared EloEngine/TeamState shape NBA/WNBA use,
without changing any of the actual formulas).

WEEKLY BATCHING - the one real structural difference from NBA/WNBA:
Games are NOT processed strictly one at a time in date order. Every
game within the same NFL week snapshots every playing team's rating
BEFORE any of that week's results are applied, and ratings only update
once, after the whole week's math is computed - see process_week().
This is deliberate: it's what lets a Thursday night game and the
following Monday night game (different calendar dates, same NFL week)
share the same starting ratings, matching how the source workbook can
only look back to an earlier WEEK, not an earlier date. Call
process_week() once per week, in chronological week order - never
process_game() on an individual game in isolation for a real result.

REST-DAY CONVENTION - also genuinely different from NBA/WNBA:
days_off here is the RAW calendar gap between a team's games (no -1),
and a team's first game of a season gets NO rest adjustment at all
(rest_adj is 0, not computed against a season-opener date). Both
match the original workbook's convention exactly - don't "fix" these
to look like NBA/WNBA's rest handling.

preview_matchup() (a single unplayed game) is unaffected by weekly
batching - it just wants each team's most recently recorded rating,
same idea as NBA/WNBA's preview.
