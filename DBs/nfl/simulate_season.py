"""
Project final season standings by simulating the remaining schedule
many times (Monte Carlo), starting from each team's CURRENT rating.

Usage:
    python3 simulate_season.py --season 2026
    python3 simulate_season.py --season 2026 --trials 5000

For each remaining game, a winner is drawn using the model's own
expected-win probability at that point in the simulated season, and a
plausible margin of victory is sampled from real historical games so
the K-factor/margin-of-victory math updates ratings the same way it
would for a real result. Remaining games are simulated WEEK BY WEEK,
in the same weekly batches the real engine uses (see engine.py) - two
games in the same simulated week never see each other's simulated
result, matching how the real engine works.

This is a projection tool, not a certainty - treat the output as "if
the model's current ratings are right and nothing unusual happens,
here's the range of plausible outcomes," not a guarantee.

Writes reports/season_projection_<season>.txt and
reports/season_projection_<season>.csv (per-team distribution of
simulated final wins and rank).
