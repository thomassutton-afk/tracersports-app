"""
Predict upcoming (unplayed) games using each team's CURRENT rating.

Usage:
    python3 predict.py                    # all upcoming games in the schedule
    python3 predict.py --season 2026      # just one season's upcoming games

This never touches `games` or the rating engine's stored state - it's
purely read-only. Ratings used are whatever's currently in the
database as of the most recently PLAYED week; unplayed games in
`schedule` have no influence on this or on each other. Unaffected by
weekly batching (see engine.py) - a preview just wants each team's
most recently recorded rating, not "what week is it."

Writes reports/upcoming_predictions.csv and prints a summary to the
terminal.
