"""
Week-by-week trust check: when can you actually start trusting
simulate_season.py's projected win totals and 10th-90th percentile
range - and how much of the band's width comes from real season
uncertainty versus an artifact of the simulation method itself?

This is a BACKTEST - it only makes sense for a season that's already
fully played out and sitting in `games`. For each checkpoint, it builds
a scratch Elo engine from only the games played on or before that date,
then projects the rest of the season THREE ways from the same starting
point:

  DYNAMIC - simulate_season.py's actual method. Ratings update game by
            game WITHIN each simulated trial at full strength, so a
            simulated winning streak raises a team's rating for its
            own later simulated games in that same trial.
  FROZEN  - every remaining game's win probability is computed ONCE
            from the current real ratings and never updated. No
            mid-trial rating drift at all.
  DAMPED  - a middle ground: ratings DO drift within a trial (same
            process_game math as DYNAMIC), but each simulated game's
            rating change is scaled down by --damping before being
            applied (default 0.5 = half strength). Real teams' quality
            does drift over a season, but a single fictional result
            probably shouldn't move a rating as much as a real one -
            this tests whether a partial update lands closer to
            honestly-calibrated than either extreme.

All three are benchmarked against a coin-flip baseline: the band width
you'd get if every remaining game were a pure 50/50 toss with zero
team-skill information. The RATIO of actual band width to that floor
is comparable across leagues even though raw win counts aren't.

Metrics per week, per method:
  - COVERAGE: % of teams whose actual final wins fell inside that
    method's projected p10-p90 band (target ~80%).
  - AVG BAND WIDTH: mean (p90 - p10) across teams, in wins.
  - COINFLIP RATIO: avg band width / coin-flip-baseline width. 1.0 =
    no more confident than random. Lower = genuinely informed.

CHECKPOINT SCHEDULE: anchored to the season's actual final day, working
backward in 7-day steps - every checkpoint after the first is exactly
7 days apart, the LAST checkpoint is the season's actual final day
(a full week), and only the first checkpoint is a partial week.

Usage:
    python3 stabilization_check.py --season 2025
    python3 stabilization_check.py --season 2025 --damping 0.3 --trials 1000
