"""
Delete one or more entire seasons from the database.

Usage:
    python3 delete_season.py --season 2012 --season 2013
    python3 delete_season.py --season 2012 --season 2013 --yes   (skip confirmation)

Deletes in the correct order (ratings before games, since ratings
references games via a foreign key), also clears any forced
fold/revival resets registered for those seasons, then rebuilds the
remaining history. Everything else - other seasons, team names,
relocation aliases - is untouched.
