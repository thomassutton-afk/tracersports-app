"""
social_card.py — renders an Instagram-ready PNG of Echo's picks for the
next upcoming slate, styled to match the live site's Games panel
(app/[league]/GamesPanel.jsx: cream background, dashed "upcoming" card,
IBM Plex Mono throughout, purple accent).

Shared by DBs/nba/add_season.py and DBs/wnba/add_season.py - each just
calls generate_next_slate_card(conn, league) once, after that variant's
ratings/predictions are rebuilt for "echo" (the card always uses Echo,
the site's default variant, regardless of which variant loop is
currently running - see the call site in add_season.py for why that's
safe to do unconditionally).

A slate with more than page_size games (8 by default) is split across
multiple images instead of cramming everything into one or truncating -
post them together as an Instagram carousel and people swipe through it.

Output: social_posts/{league}/{date}.png at the repo root (sibling of
DBs/, public/, app/) for a single-image day, or
social_posts/{league}/{date}-{page}of{total}.png for a multi-page one -
1080x1080, the standard Instagram square feed size. That folder is plain
files, so it rides along with the normal `git add . && git commit && git
push` step at the end of the daily routine - no separate backup step
needed.

Requires: Pillow (`pip install pillow`). Everything else (fonts, team
logos) is read from inside this repo, so there's nothing else to
install.
